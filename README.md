# Running collections on the command line with Newman

Newman is a command-line Collection Runner for Postman. It enables you to run and test a Postman Collection directly from the command line. It's built with extensibility in mind so that you can integrate it with your continuous integration (CI) servers and build systems.

# Integration with CI/CD

Please walk through corresponding <a href="https://github.com/ShwetankVashishtha/DSLs">Jenkins DSL</a> written in Groovy to integrate continuous builds with pipeline for your end-to-end tests.
